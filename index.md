<!-- Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [MIT CSAIL][Lab_MIT_Link] working with Professor Daniela Rus, since Jan 2023. My current work at CSAIL is centered on the development of tendon-driven soft robots utilizing computational co-design framework. Before joining MIT, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Soft Robotic Research Center (SRRC)][Lab_link] in Seoul National University (SNU), working with Professor Kyu-jin Cho (Department of Mechanical engineering, SNU). 

I believe the true allure of engineering is its ability to leverage technology to improve human lives. With this belief as my driving force, I am dedicated to developing assistive soft robots that can be used in the real world beyond the laboratory with my expertise that lies in three key areas: 1) under-actuation mechanisms, 2) tendon transmission, and 3) the design of soft robots. 

As a robot hardware designer, my primary focus revolves around answering the question: "What constitutes a good design for soft robot?" To address this question, I am currently directing my efforts towards developing: 1) a hybrid rigid-soft robot design approach, 2) a design framework that balances usability and functionality while minimizing the number of actuators required, and 3) a computational co-design approach.

I recognize that the successful development of practical assistive robots necessitates the convergence of multidisciplinary knowledge. Therefore, I am eagerly looking forward to collaborating with researchers from diverse fields to bring about these advancements.
